# Code Submission for SMU Guildhall Application

Folder structure:
- `game.cpp`: main submission file
- `monsterarenarequirements.txt`: requirement file downloaded
- `output`: linux executable compiled, could be named differently depending on the compilation code

Run `game.cpp` with at least C++14 since I'm using `make_unique()` to create unique pointers

For example: `g++ -std=c++14 -o output game.cpp`
